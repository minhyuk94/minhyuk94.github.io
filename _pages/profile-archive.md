      <p>
        Hello, I'm Minhyuk Yoo and I've been working as a software engineer in Japan since 2020.<br>
        At the first company, Secure Inc, the start-up project enables the company to take advantage of the front, backend, infrastructure, and hardware areas,I was able to participate in the development and had a variety of experiences, from initial project production to release and server construction.<br>
        Since then, I've been interested in server management, testing, automation, and other operations, so I've moved to a new job for greater growth,
        I was able to enter Rakuten, the second company, and experience operations and automation, large-scale transaction processing, deployment systems, and operations, and learn more about service operations.<br>
        I want to take advantage of this experience and improve more services.<br><br>
        The three things I think most important in my work are as follows.<br>
        <b>1. Documentation</b><br>
        I think the development and operation of services in the project can be carried out in a speedy and stable manner only when it is based on organized documents that record all of them.<br>
        In addition, I think the completion of document writing is to create documents that are easy to understand no matter who reads them, and to lead to subsequent update and management.<br>
        That's why I'm always working, but I'm trying to work while taking measures for future management instead of just looking ahead.<br>
        <b>2. Connectivity</b><br>
        First of all, I think it's important to understand the connectivity associated with my work in the project.<br>
        Since all tasks are interconnected within the project, I think it can be more understandable to carry out tasks while always understanding the surrounding tasks, and furthermore, it can help team members and collaborate and become responsible team members.<br>
        <b>3. Improvement</b><br>
        I think it's important to always have a willingness to improve the service.<br>
        To improve the service, it is necessary to rethink the existing service, and I think this will not only improve the service, but also allow you to discover the problems of the existing service and give you more in-depth knowledge.
